          <p>
            Originally from a small town in Virginia, I always felt that I belonged in a city where there was a lot of diversity and different walks of life.  With a strong desire to fulfill my dream, I worked and saved as fast and hard as I could, stuffed my car to the brim with my belongings and started my journey to sunny Los Angeles, California. </br>

            When I arrived to LA, I didn't know what type of career I wanted to pursue. Although I had years of experience in sales my heart just wasn't into it anymore. My S.O. saw how frustrating it was for me to choose a new path and pushed me to try dabbling in HTML and CSS and lo and behold I fell in <strong>LOVE</strong>.</br>

            There is so much you can teach yourself and I just had an urge to learn more within a shorter time period so I enrolled into General Assembly with gave me a strong foundation to continue grow as a Full Stack Web Developer</br>

                    <p>Growing up, my family rarely went out to eat and when we did, it was usually fast food. The suburbs has vast amounts of franchise restaurants so it quickly become mundane. It wasn't until college where I got to experience and explore what city life had to offer.  With  a multitude of different types, textures, taste and smells of food. I was in gluttony.  With that I also got experience different wines, whiskeys and beers.</p>

                    <p>My first time traveling without my family was when I was 18.  I ended up traveling all up and down the east coast.  It was almost addicting to visit a new city</p>
                    <p>My best memory ever was when I went back to my home country of Seoul, South Korea. What was only suppose to be a 2 month stay ended up being around 10 months. There, I learned how to speak, read, and write Korean fluently (my Korean was gramatically horrible prior to going). With China and Japan being close I decided to make the most of my stay in Asia and visit those countries as well.  It was my first time traveling alone.  I learned a lot about myself during this time and cherish every moment of it.</p>
